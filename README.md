# Gmail OAuth2 Python 3 Script

This has probably been done numerous times before, but here's a Python 3
version of the [Google OAuth2
Tools](https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools). My motivation: I
read my email in [Mutt](http://mutt.org) and use this (now unmaintained)
script to authenticate with my university mail service. However, Debian
recently upgraded to Python 3, which broke my mail workflow.
